# Queuing Models in OPDs / Availability of Beds / Admission of Patients (Problem Statement ID: 1620)

## Project Description
This project provides a hospital-based solution to optimize queuing models in OPDs, availability of beds, and patient admissions. The solution is designed to be integrated with a city-wide healthcare management module. It also supports inventory management for medicines and consumables. This project is implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## Problem Statement
The Government of NCT of Delhi's IT Department has outlined the need for a technological solution to manage queuing in OPDs, bed availability, and patient admissions. The project also focuses on the dispensation of various types of medicines and consumables, as well as inventory management at the hospital level.

## Key Features
- Real-time tracking of bed availability across hospitals.
- Queue management for OPD patients.
- Integration with city-wide healthcare modules.
- Inventory management for medicines and consumables.
- A dashboard for managing patient admissions and hospital resources.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (Tailwind CSS for UI styling)
